The chosen software development methodology combines Extreme programming and Feature-driven development, the course of work is tracked in Redmine. Source code of the app is versioned and tested using Gitlab. The last chapter also includes samples of configuration for some services required to run the application. This work can be used as a base point for other projects with similar sizes or to continue in the process of managing the same project.
